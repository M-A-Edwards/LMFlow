            "output": " on a person\u2019s self-esteem.\nCompare and Contrast the Effects of Individual & Societys Performance On A Persons Self Esteem The term \u201cself esteem\u201d is defined as an individuals overall evaluation or appraisal of his/her own worth (Baumeister, 1986). It can be seen that this definition implies two important aspects: firstly it refers to ones personal value system; secondly it relates directly with how one feels about him / herself in relation to others within society. This essay will discuss both these points by comparing and contrasting their effect upon each other when considering whether they are positive influences towards building up high levels of self confidence for example through achievement at school etc., or negative factors such as bullying which may lead to low self esteems. In order to do so I shall consider three different areas whereby people gain recognition from themselves and those around them \u2013 namely academic successes, physical appearance and social status. Firstly let us look briefly into what makes someone feel good about himself /herself academically speaking? One way would obviously have been if you had achieved well during your time spent studying at college or university but there could also be many more ways than just exam results alone! For instance some students might find satisfaction simply because they were able to complete all assignments handed out throughout the year without having any problems doing so whilst another student who was not quite so lucky perhaps found great pleasure in being praised by teachers after completing work successfully despite struggling initially due to lack of understanding. Another factor here too could possibly relate back to family background i.e. parents encouraged children to study hard and achieve top grades whereas siblings did little effort and still managed to get decent marks anyway. Whatever reasons exist behind why we think highly of ourselves regarding our studies however, research has shown that most young adults believe that getting better qualifications leads to higher earnings later down life therefore making money becomes very much linked together with education itself. ...read more.\nThis shows clearly then that although certain groups of people tend to receive less attention compared to others e.g. girls over boys, black pupils over white etc.; nevertheless everyone should always try to make sure he / she does everything possible to ensure maximum potential is reached regardless of gender race religion sexual orientation age disability etc.. As mentioned earlier though, sometimes even achieving excellent GCSE scores cannot guarantee future employment opportunities especially nowadays"

            "output": "\nThe main challenge is that the game of Chess has a very large state space. The number of possible positions in 10 moves from any position on board can be as high as $2^{64}$ (i.e., about one googol). This means, if we were able to store all these states and use them for training our model then it would take us more than two hundred years just to train this network! So how do you solve such problems with limited resources like time or memory constraints? One way around this problem could be using heuristics which are rules-of thumbs used by humans when they don't have enough information available at hand but still want to make some decision based upon what little data/information they already know. For example: If I am playing against someone who knows nothing about my strategy so far during the match; should I open up the center file first before moving out pieces along its sides? Or maybe move pawns towards their respective queenside squares instead since there might not even exist many threats coming down the king side yet? These kinds of questions need answers because without knowing where your opponent wants to go next - you won\u2019t really understand his intentions behind each piece movement until much later into the game \u2013 making it difficult to plan ahead effectively. In other words, having good knowledge of your own strengths & weaknesses helps immensely here. But unfortunately computers aren\u2019t capable of doing things intuitively right now due to lacking common sense reasoning abilities required to answer those types of questions above. That being said though, researchers working within fields related to Artificial Intelligence often try to come up with ways to teach machines to learn through experience rather than relying solely on predefined algorithms. And once again, Deep Learning techniques seem to provide promising results in achieving exactly that goal too."
